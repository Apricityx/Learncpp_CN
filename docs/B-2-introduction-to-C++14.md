**What is C++14?**

On August 18, 2014, the [ISO (International Organization for Standardization)](https://www.iso.org/home.html) approved a new version of C++, called C++14. Unlike C++11, which added a huge amount of new functionality, C++14 is a comparatively minor update, mainly featuring bug fixes and small improvements.

**New improvements in C++14**

For your interest, here’s a list of the major improvements that C++14 adds. Note that this list is not comprehensive, but rather intended to highlight some of the key improvements of interest.

-   Generic lambdas ([[12-7-introduction-to-lambdas-anonymous-functions|12.7 - lambda表达式简介（匿名函数）]])
-   Relaxed constexpr functions ([[6-14-Constexpr-and-consteval-functions|6.14 - Constexpr 和 consteval 函数]])
