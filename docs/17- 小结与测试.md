## 复习

通过继承程序员可以在两个对象之间实现”is-a“（是一个）的关系。被继承的对象称为父类或者基类，或者超类。而继承得到的对象则称为子类、派生类。

当一个类从另一个类派生出来时，它会获得基类的全部成员。

当派生类被构造是，其属于基类的部分会首先被构建，然后派生类部分才会构建。

1.  Memory for the derived class is set aside (enough for both the base and derived portions).
2.  The appropriate derived class constructor is called.
3.  The base class object is constructed first using the appropriate base class constructor. If no base class constructor is specified, the default constructor will be used.
4.  The initialization list of the derived class initializes members of the derived class.
5.  The body of the derived class constructor executes.
6.  Control is returned to the caller.

Destruction happens in the opposite order, from most-derived to most-base class.

C++ has 3 access specifiers: public, private, and protected. The protected access specifier allows the class the member belongs to, friends, and derived classes to access protected members, but not the public.

Classes can inherit from another class publicly, privately, or protectedly. Classes almost always inherit publicly.

Here’s a table of all of the access specifier and inheritance types combinations:

|Access specifier in base class	|Access specifier when inherited publicly	|Access specifier when inherited privately	|Access specifier when inherited protectedly|
|:----:|----:|----:|----:|
|Public|	Public	|Private	|Protected|
|Private|	Inaccessible|	Inaccessible|	Inaccessible|
|Protected|	Protected|	Private|	Protected|


Derived classes can add new functions, change the way functions that exist in the base class work in the derived class, change an inherited member’s access level, or hide functionality.

Multiple inheritance enables a derived class to inherit members from more than one parent. You should generally avoid multiple inheritance unless alternatives lead to more complexity.
