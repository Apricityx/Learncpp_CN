# 1.7 关键字和命名标识符

## 关键字

C++ 预留了 92 个词自用(对于 C++20 而言) 。这些词称为**关键字**(或保留字)，每个关键字在C++中都有其特定的含义。 

下表列举了 C++ 20 中的全部关键字：

![[keyword.png]]

关键字后有标识 C++20 的，属于 C++20 新增的关键字。如果你的编译器不支持 C++ 20（或者其具备 C++20 功能但默认是关闭的），这些关键字将不具备实际用途。

C++ 还定义了一些特殊的标识符：`override`、`final`、`import` 和 `module`。这些标识符在特定上下文中具有特殊的含义，但它们并不是C++保留字。

你已经接触过其中的一些关键字，包括 `int` 和 `return`。这些关键字、标识符以及一组运算符就构成了 C++ 语言的全部（预处理器指令除外）。由于关键字和特殊的标识符具有特殊含义，因此你的 IDE 通常会将其标记为不同的颜色以使其更加醒目。

By the time you are done with this tutorial series, you will understand what almost all of these words do!

## 命名规则

As a reminder, the name of a variable (or function, type, or other kind of item) is called an identifier. C++ gives you a lot of flexibility to name identifiers as you wish. However, there are a few rules that must be followed when naming identifiers:

-   The identifier can not be a keyword. Keywords are reserved.
-   The identifier can only be composed of letters (lower or upper case), numbers, and the underscore character. That means the name can not contain symbols (except the underscore) nor whitespace (spaces or tabs).
-   The identifier must begin with a letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore. It can not start with a number.
-   C++ is case sensitive, and thus distinguishes between lower and upper case letters. `nvalue` is different than `nValue` is different than `NVALUE`.

## 命名最佳实践

Now that you know how you _can_ name a variable, let’s talk about how you _should_ name a variable (or function).

First, it is a convention in C++ that variable names should begin with a lowercase letter. If the variable name is one word, the whole thing should be written in lowercase letters.

```cpp
int value; // correct

int Value; // incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
int VALUE; // incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
int VaLuE; // incorrect (see your psychiatrist) ;)
```


Most often, function names are also started with a lowercase letter (though there’s some disagreement on this point). We’ll follow this convention, since function _main_ (which all programs must have) starts with a lowercase letter, as do all of the functions in the C++ standard library.

Identifier names that start with a capital letter are typically used for user-defined types (such as structs, classes, and enumerations, all of which we will cover later).

If the variable or function name is multi-word, there are two common conventions: words separated by underscores, called snake_case, or intercapped (sometimes called camelCase, since the capital letters stick up like the humps on a camel).

```cpp
int my_variable_name; // correct (separated by underscores/snake_case)
int my_function_name(); // correct (separated by underscores/snake_case)

int myVariableName; // correct (intercapped/CamelCase)
int myFunctionName(); // correct (intercapped/CamelCase)

int my variable name; // invalid (whitespace not allowed)
int my function name(); // invalid (whitespace not allowed)

int MyVariableName; // valid but incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
int MyFunctionName(); // valid but incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
```


In this tutorial, we will typically use the intercapped approach because it’s easier to read (it’s easy to mistake an underscore for a space in dense blocks of code). But it’s common to see either -- the C++ standard library uses the underscore method for both variables and functions. Sometimes you’ll see a mix of the two: underscores used for variables and intercaps used for functions.

It’s worth noting that if you’re working in someone else’s code, it’s generally considered better to match the style of the code you are working in than to rigidly follow the naming conventions laid out above.

Second, you should avoid naming your identifiers starting with an underscore, as these names are typically reserved for OS, library, and/or compiler use.

Third, your identifiers should make clear what the value they are holding means (particularly if the units aren’t obvious). Identifiers should be named in a way that would help someone who has no idea what your code does be able to figure it out as quickly as possible. In 3 months, when you look at your program again, you’ll have forgotten how it works, and you’ll thank yourself for picking variable names that make sense.

However, giving a trivial variable an overly complex name impedes overall understanding of what the program is doing almost as much as giving a widely used identifier an inadequate name. Therefore, a good rule of thumb is to make the length of an identifier proportional to how widely it is used. An identifier with a trivial use can have a short name (e.g. such as _i_). An identifier that is used more broadly (e.g. a function that is called from many different places in a program) should have a longer and more descriptive name (e.g. instead of _open_, try _openFileOnDisk_).

In any case, avoid abbreviations. Although they reduce the time you need to write your code, they make your code harder to read. Even if the abbreviation is unambiguous, it takes the reader a moment to figure out what you meant. Code is read more often than it is written, the time you saved while writing the code is time that every reader, including the future you, wastes when reading it. If you’re looking to write code faster, use your editor’s auto-complete feature.

Finally, a clarifying comment can go a long way. For example, say we’ve declared a variable named _numberOfChars_ that is supposed to store the number of characters in a piece of text. Does the text “Hello World!” have 10, 11, or 12 characters? It depends on whether we’re including whitespace or punctuation. Rather than naming the variable _numberOfCharsIncludingWhitespaceAndPunctuation_, which is rather lengthy, a well placed comment on the declaration line should help the user figure it out:

```cpp
// holds number of chars in a piece of text -- including whitespace and punctuation!
int numberOfChars;
```
