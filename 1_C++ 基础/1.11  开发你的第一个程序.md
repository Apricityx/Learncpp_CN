# 1.11 开发你的第一个程序

前面的课程已经介绍了不少术语和概念，这些术语和概念几乎会在我们编写的任何程序中出现。在本节课中，我们会运用所学的内容，动手编写一个简单的程序。

## 翻倍程序

首先，我们会要求用户输入一个整型数并等待用户完成输入，然后我们会将该值乘以2并告诉用户计算结果。上述程序的输出结果如下（假设输入值为 4）：

```
Enter an integer: 4
Double that number is: 8
```

下面让我们来**逐步**完成上述功能：
> [!TIP] 最佳实践
> 新手程序员常会去尝试一次性完成整个程序的编写，然后便会因为大量报错信息而感到无所适从。比较好的方式是每次添加一部分内容并保证其能够通过编译和通过测试。当你能够确保其正确工作后，再编写接下来的代码。

本节课也会采取上述策略。我们会将程序的实现分为多个步骤，请将各步骤中的代码**输入**（不要复制粘贴）计算机，编译并且运行。

首先，创建一个新的控制台程序项目。

现在，编写一个基本的程序框架。我们知道，编写一个 `main()` 程序是必不可少的步骤（因为C++程序必须具有一个 main函数）。如果你的IDE没有为你自动创建一个空的空函数的话，请像下面这样自行编写一个：

```cpp
int main()
{
	return 0;
}
```

由于需要向控制台输出信息以及从用户获取数，因此必须要包含 `iostream` 头文件以便能够访问 `std::cout` 和 `std::cin`。

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	return 0;
}
```


现在，向用户发送信息，提示他输入一个整型：

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	return 0;
}
```


至此，该程序应该能够得到如下的输出结果：

```
Enter an integer:
```

然后程序就终止了。

接下来，需要从用户获取输入信息，这里使用 `std::cin` 和 `operator>>` 来完成。但是我们必须定义一个用来存放输入结果的变量。

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	int num{ }; // define variable num as an integer variable
	std::cin << num; // get integer value from user's keyboard

	return 0;
}
```

是时候再次编译程序了...

糟糕！作者的 Visual Studio 2017 报告了如下信息：

```
1>------ Build started: Project: Double, Configuration: Release Win32 ------
1>Double.cpp
1>c:\vcprojects\double\double.cpp(8): error C2678: binary '<<': no operator found which takes a left-hand operand of type 'std::istream' (or there is no acceptable conversion)
1>c:\vcprojects\double\double.cpp: note: could be 'built-in C++ operator<<(bool, int)'
1>c:\vcprojects\double\double.cpp: note: while trying to match the argument list '(std::istream, int)'
1>Done building project "Double.vcxproj" -- FAILED.
========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========
```

有编译错误！

首先，由于这次编译发生在最新一次代码修改之后，然后就报错了，说明错误是在最后一次修改代码时被引入的（7、8两行）。因此，我们需要分析的代码相对于全部代码起始是很少的。第七行非常简单（仅仅定义了一个变量），错误That significantly reduces the amount of code we have to scan to find the error. Line 7 is pretty straightforward (just a variable definition), so the error probably isn’t there. That leaves line 8 as the likely culprit.

Second, this error message isn’t very easy to read. But let’s pick apart some key elements: The compiler is telling us it ran into the error on line 8. That means the actual error is probably on line 8, or possibly the preceding line, which reinforces our previous assessment. Next, the compiler is telling you that it couldn’t find a ‘<<‘ operator that has a left-hand operand of type std::istream (which is the type of std::cin). Put another way, operator<< doesn’t know what to do with std::cin, so the error must be either with our use of std::cin or our use of operator<<.

See the error now? If you don’t, take a moment and see if you can find it.

Here’s the program that contains the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	int num{ };
	std::cin >> num; // std::cin uses operator >>, not operator <<!

	return 0;
}
```

COPY

Now the program will compile, and we can test it. The program will wait for you to enter a number, so let’s enter 4. The output should look like this:

Enter an integer: 4

Almost there! Last step is to double the number.

Once we finish this last step, our program will compile and run successfully, producing the desired output.

There are (at least) 3 ways we can go about this. Let’s go from worst to best.

The not-good solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// worst version
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	int num{ };
	std::cin >> num;

	num = num * 2; // double num's value, then assign that value back to num

	std::cout << "Double that number is: " << num << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

COPY

In this solution, we use an expression to multiply _num_ by 2, and then assign that value back to _num_. From that point forward, _num_ will contain our doubled number.

Why this is a bad solution:

-   Before the assignment statement, num contains the user’s input. After the assignment, it contains a different value. That’s confusing.
-   We overwrote the user’s input by assigning a new value to the input variable, so if we wanted to extend our program to do something else with that input value later (e.g. triple the user’s input), it’s already been lost.

The mostly-good solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// less-bad version
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	int num{ };
	std::cin >> num;

	int doublenum{ num * 2 }; // define a new variable and initialize it with num * 2
	std::cout << "Double that number is: " << doublenum << '\n'; // then print the value of that variable here

	return 0;
}
```

COPY

This solution is pretty straightforward to read and understand, and resolves both of the problems encountered in the worst solution.

The primary downside here is that we’re defining a new variable (which adds complexity) to store a value we only use once. We can do better.

The preferred solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// preferred version
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	int num{ };
	std::cin >> num;

	std::cout << "Double that number is: " <<  num * 2 << '\n'; // use an expression to multiply num * 2 at the point where we are going to print it

	return 0;
}
```

COPY

This is the preferred solution of the bunch. When std::cout executes, the expression _num * 2_ will get evaluated, and the result will be double _num_‘s value. That value will get printed. The value in _num_ itself will not be altered, so we can use it again later if we wish.

This version is our reference solution.

Author’s note

The first and primary goal of programming is to make your program work. A program that doesn’t work isn’t useful regardless of how well it’s written.

However, there’s a saying I’m fond of: “You have to write a program once to know how you should have written it the first time.” This speaks to the fact that the best solution often isn’t obvious, and that our first solutions to problems are usually not as good as they could be.

When we’re focused on figuring out how to make our programs work, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to invest a lot of time into code we don’t even know if we’ll keep. So we take shortcuts. We skip things like error handling and comments. We sprinkle debugging code throughout our solution to help us diagnose issues and find errors. We learn as we go -- things we thought might work don’t work after all, and we have to backtrack and try another approach.

The end result is that our initial solutions often aren’t well structured, robust (error-proof), readable, or concise. So once your program is working, your job really isn’t done (unless the program is a one-off/throwaway). The next step is to cleanup your code. This involves things like: removing (or commenting out) temporary/debugging code, adding comments, handling error cases, formatting your code, and ensuring best practices are followed. And even then, your program may not be as simple as it could be -- perhaps there is redundant logic that can be consolidated, or multiple statements that can be combined, or variables that aren’t needed, or a thousand other little things that could be simplified. Too often new programmers focus on optimizing for performance when they should be optimizing for maintainability.

Very few of the solutions presented in these tutorials came out great the first time. Rather, they’re the result of continual refinement until nothing else could be found to improve. And in many cases, readers still find plenty of other things to suggest as improvements!

All of this is really to say: don’t be frustrated if/when your solutions don’t come out wonderfully optimized right out of your brain. That’s normal. Perfection in programming is an iterative process (one requiring repeated passes).

Author’s note

One more thing: You may be thinking, “C++ has so many rules and concepts. How do I remember all of this stuff?”.

Short answer: You don’t. C++ is one part using what you know, and two parts looking up how to do the rest.

As you read through this site for the first time, focus less on memorizing specifics, and more on understanding what’s possible. Then, when you have a need to implement something in a program you’re writing, you can come back here (or to a reference site) and refresh yourself on how to do so.
